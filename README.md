Certainly! Here's a sample README file description repository that includes a brief overview of your Spring Boot project for employee management with a focus on the table structure:

# Employee Management System - Spring Boot Project

This is a Spring Boot project designed for managing employee data, including Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations. The project is built in Java and utilizes a MySQL database with a specific table structure to store employee information.

## Table Structure

The project uses a MySQL database with the following table structure:

### `employees` Table

- `empid` (INT): Primary key for identifying employees.
- `fname` (VARCHAR(25)) NOT NULL: First name of the employee.
- `lname` (VARCHAR(25)) NOT NULL: Last name of the employee.
- `mailid` (VARCHAR(25)) NOT NULL: Email ID of the employee.
- `department` (VARCHAR(25)) NOT NULL: The department to which the employee belongs.
- `location` (VARCHAR(25)) NOT NULL: The location or office of the employee.
- `salary` (DECIMAL(10, 2)) NOT NULL: The salary of the employee.

Each column in the `employees` table has constraints to ensure that values are not null and do not contain empty strings.

## Features

- **Create Employee**: Add new employee records to the database.
- **Read Employee**: Retrieve employee information, including searching by employee ID.
- **Update Employee**: Modify existing employee records.
- **Delete Employee**: Remove employee records from the database.
- **Additional Operations**: Operations specific to employee management needs. Please refer the [Additional Operations](##_Additional_Operations)


- ## Additional Operations

In addition to the basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, this Employee Management REST API project offers a range of additional operations to enhance functionality, including:

### Audit Trail

The audit functionality allows you to track and maintain a record of important events and changes within the employee management system. It's essential for ensuring data integrity and accountability. The following audit operations are available:

- **View Audit Logs**: `GET /audit` - Retrieve a log of audit events, providing insights into who performed specific actions and when.
- **Filter by Action Type**: `GET /audit?action={actionType}` - Filter audit logs by specific action types (e.g., Create, Update, Delete).
- **Filter by Employee ID**: `GET /audit?empid={empid}` - Filter audit logs by the employee ID to view actions related to a specific employee.
